# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of this was probably creating the end game functions, it was hard to figure out what should qualify as a win and how the numbering system works.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Add a computer function that would be set to run everytime that a player takes a move. It would have similar code to the end game checking if the player has any two in a rows if so it should be placed on the third spot to block a win. This would take alot of code and i am not exactly sure how to shorten it. There would be an if statement the means if the player has no two in a row the computer would place next too one of its own squares, if that isn't available ethier place in the middle.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
